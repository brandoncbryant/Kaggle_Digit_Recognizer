# Kaggle_Digit_Recognizer
A Kaggle submission for the MNIST Digit Recognizer competition. The dataset contains 42000 entries of images of handwritten numbers 0-9. The images are in grayscale and have 28x28 pixels with values of 0-255 with 0 representing black and 255 representing white. The pixel information can be reshaped into a 1D array of length 784, which means there are 784 feature variables. Many pixels are black in every image which means they have no variance. To reduce dimensionality, the features are standardized and a low variance filter is applied to each feature (pixel) which reduces the number of features to 250. A support vector machine model is then trained on the data. During validation, it was observed that the prediction results were not very sensitive to the hyperparameters and so the hyperparameters are tuned by trial. Kaggle evaluates the model on classification accuracy and the model scores 95.8%.
